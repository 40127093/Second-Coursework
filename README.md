# Second-Coursework - ArtsySocial

“Artsy-Social” is a micro social network developed for talented people that simply want to showcase their creative work pieces as well as to form social connections with people from similar backgrounds. The concept of Artsy-Social was inspired by existing popular social media platforms such as Twitter, Facebook, LinkeIn and it was an effort to design a user-friendly platform that would support and offer known to users features but would be also benefited by some unique implementations, no previously attempted. Its brand name derives from the words, “artsy” which is a slang word used to describe people involved in artistic endeavours, and the word “social”.
 	Currently this web application gives users the ability to create new accounts and then use their personal credentials to log in and access the full content of the application. ArtsySocial was designed to essentially give users the ability to showcase their personal portfolios online and share them along with other personal information with the rest of the world. At this point, this facility has been developed only as a prototype to demonstrate its functionality; however there are future plans to develop it as a fully functional framework.
	The main feature, ‘ArtsySocial’ currently provides is a social media environment where only registered users have the ability to post messages in their personal stream feeds as well as querying other users’ profiles. The application also gives users the option to follow or unfollow people, which allows them to build social connections or in some cases even relationships. Although posted messages of users become immediately available in their personal profiles, in order for other users to be able to view a specific user’s posts in their personal post feeds they are required to be following that particular user. In the case they are not following them they need to query specifically this user to view their stream feed.
